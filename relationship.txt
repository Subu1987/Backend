// here we have two collections employee & department,
// there is one to many relationship between department & employee(cause one department can have many employees)
// & now to create relationship we pass reference id or primary key of department collection to employee collection
// in employee collection we know that one employee subrato belongs to IT department by referencing the id

// embedding: only in mongodb, we can pass employees id in department collection as an Array like this :

// many to many relationship:
// if we have many to many relationship, to create relationship between two collections then create one more collection that will hold reference of both
// now in this case, actors & movies have many to many relationship, cause one actor can work in many movies & one movie can have many actors
// so problem we are facing here, how can we pass reference id to make relationship between them 
// so what we do, we create a separate collection & passing reference id as a foreign key of our both collection so that it can reference.
// we can name this collection, movie_actor collection
